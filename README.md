# Nano-cellular Exploration: A school biology project
Nano-cellular Exploration began as an 8th grade biology project in 2022. 

Submitted to a culminating biology assignment, Nano-cellular Exploration was a small video game built to display my knowledge of the human cell and its organelles. 
In the future, the player takes control of a nanobot to explore the inside of the cell. 

## Process
Over the course of 2 months, the project underwent several different phases:
- Research phase, requiring a detailed knowledge of the organelles of the human cell and how they interact with each other
- Planning phase, conceptualizing the game and the player's task
- Design phase, painting all game art via a graphical tablet on Krita
- Development phase, programming and designing all game logic on Godot

## Credit
This project (including all art and code) was created by James Lian.
